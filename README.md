# CryptoCurrencyApp

This is a UI project based on a tutorial I followed in YouTube using bare workflow (React Native CLI). I changed a few things i.e. anything with box with shadows as a reusable component. The data is a dummy JSON.

Objective of this project is to explore different ways to organize my code and making floating components.

## Screenshots
